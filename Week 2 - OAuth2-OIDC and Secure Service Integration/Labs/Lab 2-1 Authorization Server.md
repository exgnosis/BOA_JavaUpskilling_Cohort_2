# Lab 2-1: Authorization Server
## Hands-On Setup Exercise

> **Course:** MD282 - Java Full-Stack Development
> **Module:** 3 - OAuth2 / OIDC Foundations and Spring Security
> **Estimated time:** 30 to 45 minutes

---

## How to Use This Exercise

This is a standalone setup exercise. All subsequent Module 3 exercises (Resource Server configuration, secured external API consumption, token verification) depend on the Authorization Server you build here. Complete this exercise first and keep the IntelliJ window the Authorization Server is running in open throughout the lab session.

Each section follows the same pattern as the labs you have already completed:

- **Context**: why this concept matters and what problem it solves
- **Setup**: how to structure the project and files before you start
- **Tasks**: step-by-step work, with complete code (no `TODO` markers in this lab; the goal is a working server, not an exercise in completing stubs)
- **Checkpoints**: questions that test conceptual understanding, not just code completion

> **Tip:** Read every comment in the configuration class. Each block maps directly to a concept covered in the Module 3 lectures. The Authorization Server is not large in line count but every line is doing something specific, and understanding the wiring here is what makes the rest of Module 3 tractable.

> **Capstone alignment:** The Authorization Server you build here is the same one the capstone uses to issue tokens for the banking API. The users, clients, and custom claims defined in this lab carry forward unchanged. Treat this as the security backbone of the capstone, not a throwaway exercise.

---

## Overview

When complete, you will have:

- An Authorization Server running on port 9000
- Two registered clients: one for interactive user login (Authorization Code with PKCE) and one for service-to-service calls (Client Credentials)
- Five test users covering three roles: three account holders, one teller, one auditor
- A JWKS endpoint that Resource Servers use to verify token signatures
- Custom claims (`preferred_username`, `name`, `roles`) added to user tokens, with `sub` set to a stable domain identifier (customer ID / employee ID) rather than the login name

> **Important:** The Module 3 exercises and this Authorization Server must both use **Spring Boot 3.2.x**. This is not an option in the initializr so we will download it with 3.5 and modify it in one of the lab steps.

---

## Starter Project

### Step 1: Create the Project with Spring Initializr

1. Open [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) in a browser
2. Configure the project as follows:

| Setting | Value                  |
|---|------------------------|
| Project | Maven                  |
| Language | Java                   |
| Spring Boot | **3.5** Modified Later |
| Group | `com.example`          |
| Artifact | `authserver`           |
| Packaging | Jar                    |
| Java | 21                     |

3. Add the following dependencies using the search box:
   - **Spring Web**
   - **OAuth2 Authorization Server**

4. Click **Generate**, unzip the archive, and open the folder in IntelliJ IDEA using **File → Open → New Window**

5. When IntelliJ finishes indexing, open the Maven tool window (**View → Tool Windows → Maven**) and confirm there are no download errors

### Step 2: Verify and Adjust the Dependencies

Open `pom.xml` and confirm the `<dependencies>` block contains the following. If the content differs, replace it with this exactly:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-security-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Change the `<parent>` block so that it specifies Spring Boot 3.2.5. Spring Initializr defaults to 3.5, which ships a version of the Authorization Server library that is not compatible with the resource servers you will build in subsequent Module 3 exercises. The correct block is:

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.5</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>
```

After making any changes, right-click `pom.xml` and choose **Maven → Reload Project**.

Verify the correct version resolved by running the following in the IntelliJ terminal:

```bash
mvn dependency:tree | grep authorization-server
```

You should see a version beginning with `1.2`:

```
\- org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server:jar:1.2.x
```

If you see `7.0.x` the Spring Boot version is wrong. Correct the `<parent>` version and reload again.

### Step 3: Confirm Your Package Name

Open the main application class (named `AuthserverApplication.java`) and confirm the first line is:

```java
package com.example.authserver;
```

This is the base package every class in this exercise will use. The instructions below assume `com.example.authserver` throughout. Using the artifact name `authserver` (no hyphen) keeps the package name a single legal Java identifier, which avoids the hyphen-to-separator translation Spring Initializr would otherwise apply.

## Exercise 1: Building the Authorization Server

**Estimated time:** 30 to 45 minutes
**Topics covered:** Authorization Server vs Resource Server vs Client, OAuth2 protocol endpoints, registered clients, public vs confidential clients, PKCE, JWT signing with RSA keys, JWKS, OIDC, custom token claims, in-memory user details, roles vs scopes, stable subject identifiers

### Context

An Authorization Server is the trust anchor of an OAuth2 system. It is the only component in the architecture that is permitted to issue access tokens, and every Resource Server in the ecosystem trusts it implicitly. When a client wants to call a protected API, it first obtains a token from the Authorization Server. When a Resource Server receives that token, it verifies the signature against the Authorization Server's public key (published at the JWKS endpoint), checks the claims, and either allows or rejects the request.

Three things make the Authorization Server worth understanding deeply rather than treating as a black box:

1. **It is the source of identity.** Every claim in a JWT (the user's roles, the client that obtained the token, the scopes that were granted, the expiry) is decided here. Understanding which claims are set and why is the difference between a security model you can reason about and one you trust by default.

2. **It enforces the client contract.** Each application that talks to the Authorization Server must be registered ahead of time, with specific grant types, redirect URIs, scopes, and authentication methods. Misconfiguration here is a frequent source of bugs that look like Resource Server failures.

3. **The flows are not interchangeable.** Authorization Code + PKCE is for users in browsers; Client Credentials is for backend services. Using one where the other is appropriate is a security failure, not a stylistic one. Building the server forces you to see why.

#### Two ideas this lab makes concrete

Before you start, two design decisions in this lab are worth flagging because they appear in every checkpoint and carry forward into the capstone.

**Subject (`sub`) is a stable domain identifier, not the login name.** OIDC requires `sub` to be stable, non-reassignable, and unique within the issuer. Login names ("alice") fail all three: they change, they can be reassigned, and they are display-oriented. In this lab, `sub` is the customer ID (`C001`) for account holders, the employee ID (`EM01`) for tellers, and the auditor ID (`AUD01`) for auditors. The login name goes into the standard OIDC `preferred_username` claim. The payoff appears in the Resource Server exercises: when your domain model keys `Account` by `customerId`, an authorization check is literally `account.customerId.equals(authentication.getName())` with no translation step.

**Roles and scopes answer different questions.** A role describes who the user *is* (`account_holder`, `teller`, `auditor`) — coarse-grained and stable across sessions. A scope describes what *this token* is allowed to do (`account.read`, `account.write`, ...) — fine-grained and per-token. In OAuth, a single user may legitimately request a token with only a subset of the scopes their role entitles them to (principle of least privilege per token). You will see both in your `@PreAuthorize` expressions in Lab 2-2: `hasRole('TELLER')` for ownership-style checks and `hasAuthority('SCOPE_account.write')` for capability checks.

#### The users and clients this lab defines

In this exercise you will build a single configuration class that defines two filter chains (protocol endpoints and login form), five users (three account holders, a teller, an auditor), two clients (a public SPA client and a confidential service client), a token customizer that adds application-specific claims and rewrites `sub`, and the RSA key pair that signs every token. The end result is a working Authorization Server you can call from the rest of Module 3.

| Login    | `sub`   | Role              | Full Name             |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| `alice`  | `C001`  | `account_holder`  | Alice Nguyen          |
| `bob`    | `C002`  | `account_holder`  | Bob Patel             |
| `carla`  | `C003`  | `account_holder`  | Carla Romero          |
| `edward` | `EM01`  | `teller`          | Edward Teller         |
| `audit`  | `AUD01` | `auditor`         | Sunrise Accounting    |

All five users share the password `password`. This is acceptable for a lab environment and **only** for a lab environment. Production systems must use per-user passwords, BCrypt hashing, and an account lockout policy.

#### Scopes defined by this server

The seven scopes below are all the scopes any client in this ecosystem will request. Each role has a default scope set:

| Scope                 | Meaning                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `account.read`        | Read account details and balance              |
| `account.write`       | Modify account details (not balance directly) |
| `account.create`      | Open a new account                            |
| `transaction.read`    | Read transaction history                      |
| `transaction.create`  | Post a new transaction (deposit/withdraw/transfer) |
| `customer.read`       | Read customer profile data                    |
| `customer.write`      | Modify customer profile data                  |

| Role             | Default scopes                                                                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `account_holder` | `account.read`, `account.write`, `transaction.read`, `transaction.create`, `customer.read`                |
| `teller`         | All `account_holder` scopes **plus** `account.create`, `customer.write`                                   |
| `auditor`        | `account.read`, `transaction.read`, `customer.read` (read-only across the system; no writes, no creates)  |



### Task 1.1: Configure the Server Properties

Delete `src/main/resources/application.properties` if it exists and create `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 9000

logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.security: DEBUG
```

The DEBUG logging is intentional. It lets you see every security decision the Authorization Server makes in the console, which helps you understand the OAuth2 flow as it runs. In a production deployment you would set this to INFO or WARN; for a learning environment, the verbose output is the point.

### Task 1.2: Create the BankUser Class

Standard `User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()` only carries a username, password, and authorities. Our token customizer needs more: the customer/employee ID for `sub`, the full name for the `name` claim, and the user's allowed scopes. The cleanest way to carry these into the customizer is a custom `UserDetails` implementation.

Create the package `com.example.authserver.users` and inside it create `BankUser.java`:

```java
package com.example.authserver.users;

import org.springframework.security.core.GrantedAuthority;
import org.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthority;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;

/**
 * A UserDetails implementation that carries the domain attributes
 * this Authorization Server needs to put into the JWT:
 *
 *   subjectId      -- becomes the "sub" claim (C001, EM01, AUD01, ...)
 *   username       -- the login name (alice, edward, ...) -> "preferred_username"
 *   fullName       -- display name -> "name"
 *   role           -- single role like "account_holder", "teller", "auditor"
 *   allowedScopes  -- the maximum scope set this user is entitled to
 *
 * The token customizer pulls these directly off the principal at JWT
 * encoding time. Storing them here (rather than in a parallel map)
 * keeps the user's identity and the user's authorization data
 * in one place.
 */
public class BankUser implements UserDetails {

    private final String subjectId;
    private final String username;
    private final String password;
    private final String fullName;
    private final String role;
    private final Set<String> allowedScopes;

    public BankUser(String subjectId,
                    String username,
                    String password,
                    String fullName,
                    String role,
                    Set<String> allowedScopes) {
        this.subjectId = subjectId;
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
        this.fullName = fullName;
        this.role = role;
        this.allowedScopes = Set.copyOf(allowedScopes);
    }

    public String getSubjectId() {
        return subjectId;
    }

    public String getFullName() {
        return fullName;
    }

    public String getRole() {
        return role;
    }

    public Set<String> getAllowedScopes() {
        return allowedScopes;
    }

    // UserDetails contract below.
    // Spring Security uses ROLE_ as a prefix convention so that hasRole('TELLER')
    // matches an authority named ROLE_TELLER. We follow that convention here.

    @Override
    public Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities() {
        return List.of(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_" + role.toUpperCase()));
    }

    @Override public String getPassword() { return password; }
    @Override public String getUsername() { return username; }
    @Override public boolean isAccountNonExpired() { return true; }
    @Override public boolean isAccountNonLocked() { return true; }
    @Override public boolean isCredentialsNonExpired() { return true; }
    @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; }
}
```

### Task 1.3: Create the Configuration Class

Create the package `com.example.authserver.config` (adjust for your actual package name from Step 3).

Inside it, create `AuthorizationServerConfig.java` with the following content. Read every comment. Each section maps directly to a concept covered in the Module 3 lectures:

### Task 1.4: Start the Server

> **Why not `InMemoryUserDetailsManager`?** It is the obvious choice and most Spring Security tutorials use it. We do not, because it silently strips custom `UserDetails` subtypes. Internally it wraps every `UserDetails` you pass it and, on lookup, hands back a plain `org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User` rebuilt from the wrapped fields. Our token customizer's `instanceof BankUser` check would then always be false, the entire customizer body would be skipped, and the JWT would come out with `sub` set to the login name, no `roles`, no `name`, no `preferred_username`, and an unfiltered `scope` claim. The lambda `UserDetailsService` in this task returns the `BankUser` instance unchanged, which is what the customizer needs.

Run the main application class. You should see it start on port 9000. The DEBUG logging will produce a large amount of filter chain output. This is normal.

Look for this line near the end of the startup output:

```
Started AuthserverApplication in X.XXX seconds
```

### Task 1.5: Verify the Key Endpoints

Open the following URLs in your browser to confirm the server is running and exposing the right endpoints.

**JWKS endpoint**, the public keys Resource Servers use to verify signatures:

```
http://localhost:9000/oauth2/jwks
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "keys": [{
    "kty": "RSA",
    "e": "AQAB",
    "kid": "some-generated-uuid",
    "n": "a-very-long-base64url-encoded-number..."
  }]
}
```

**Discovery endpoint**, the document that clients and Resource Servers use to auto-configure:

```
http://localhost:9000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

Note the `issuer`, `token_endpoint`, and `jwks_uri` fields in the response. These are the values you will configure in the resource servers during the rest of Module 3.

### Task 1.6: Obtain Your First Tokens

Create `auth-requests.http` in the project root:

```http
### Client Credentials token. Service identity, no user involved.
### The Authorization header is Base64("bank-service:bank-service-secret").
POST http://localhost:9000/oauth2/token
Authorization: Basic YmFuay1zZXJ2aWNlOmJhbmstc2VydmljZS1zZWNyZXQ=
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&scope=account.read transaction.read

###

### Authorization Code flow, Step 1.
### Open the URL below manually in your browser (do not run it as an HTTP request).
### Log in as alice / password (or bob, carla, edward, audit) and approve the
### scopes on the consent screen.
### The browser redirects to http://127.0.0.1:9000/authorized?code=XXXX
### Copy the "code" query parameter value from the URL bar before it expires.
###
### IMPORTANT: the authorize URL host (127.0.0.1) MUST match the redirect_uri
### host (127.0.0.1). The browser treats "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" as
### different origins -- if the authorize URL uses one and the redirect_uri
### uses the other, the session cookie is lost on the redirect and you will
### be asked to log in a second time.
###
### URL to open in browser (request the full set of bank scopes; the customizer
### will narrow them to what the logged-in user is entitled to):
###
### http://127.0.0.1:9000/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=bank-spa&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:9000/authorized&scope=openid%20profile%20account.read%20account.write%20account.create%20transaction.read%20transaction.create%20customer.read%20customer.write&code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM&code_challenge_method=S256&state=abc123

###

### Authorization Code flow, Step 2.
### Replace CODE_FROM_BROWSER with the value from the browser URL bar.
### The code_verifier matches the code_challenge in the URL above.
POST http://127.0.0.1:9000/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=CODE_FROM_BROWSER
&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:9000/authorized
&client_id=bank-spa
&code_verifier=dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk
```

Execute the Client Credentials request first. You should receive:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ii4uLiJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "account.read transaction.read"
}
```

Copy the `access_token` value and paste it into the decoder at [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io). Note that the payload contains `iss`, `sub` (which is `bank-service`, the client ID), `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, and `scope` — but no `roles`, `preferred_username`, or `name`. That is the expected behaviour for a client-credentials token; no user is present.

Now run the Authorization Code flow as **alice**. Decode the resulting token and confirm:

- `sub` is `C001` (not `alice`)
- `preferred_username` is `alice`
- `name` is `Alice Nguyen`
- `roles` is `["account_holder"]`
- `scope` is `openid profile account.read account.write transaction.read transaction.create customer.read` — `account.create` and `customer.write` are absent because alice is not entitled to them, even though the client requested them.

Repeat as **edward** and confirm `scope` now includes `account.create` and `customer.write`. Repeat as **audit** and confirm `scope` is reduced to read-only.

### Checkpoints

1. The Authorization Server defines two filter chains, both annotated with `@Order`. What goes wrong if the order is reversed or if neither chain is given an explicit order?

2. The `bank-spa` client requires PKCE (`requireProofKey(true)`) and has `ClientAuthenticationMethod.NONE`. The `bank-service` client uses `CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC` and has no PKCE requirement. Why are these settings appropriate for each client type, and what specifically would go wrong if they were swapped?

3. The token customizer adds `roles`, `preferred_username`, and `name` only when the principal is a `BankUser`. A token obtained via Client Credentials therefore contains none of these. From the Resource Server's perspective, what does this imply about how `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('TELLER')")` will behave on a service-to-service call?

4. The customizer overrides `sub` to be the customer or employee ID (`C001`, `EM01`, `AUD01`) instead of the login name (`alice`, `edward`, `audit`). Explain *why* in terms of what the Resource Server has to do in a method like `@PreAuthorize("@accountSecurity.isOwner(#accountId, authentication)")`. What would the implementation of `isOwner` look like if `sub` were `alice` and accounts were keyed by `customerId`?

5. The customizer narrows the `scope` claim to `(requested ∩ allowed)` rather than just trusting the client's request. What attack or misconfiguration does this defend against? If `audit` logs in via `bank-spa` and the client requests `account.write` in addition to read scopes, what does `audit`'s token end up with, and why?

6. The RSA key pair is generated fresh on every server restart. Why is this acceptable in development and unacceptable in production? What specific behaviour would a deployed Resource Server exhibit on the morning after an unannounced Authorization Server restart in production?

7. Each `BankUser` currently has a single `role` field. If a teller could also be an account holder (i.e. a teller with their own personal account at the bank), what would change in `BankUser`, in the token customizer, and in a `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('TELLER') or @accountSecurity.isOwner(...)")` expression?

## Troubleshooting

**Port 9000 is already in use**

Change `server.port` in `application.yml` to another port, update `issuer` in `AuthorizationServerSettings` to match, and use the new port when configuring the resource servers in Module 3.

**The application fails to start with a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`**

The most common cause is a missing `@EnableWebSecurity` annotation on `AuthorizationServerConfig`. Verify it is present.

**Login fails with "Bad credentials"**

The lab uses BCrypt to hash passwords. Confirm the `PasswordEncoder` bean is defined and that the `UserDetailsService` calls `encoder.encode("password")` rather than passing the literal string.

**Token is issued but `sub` is the login name (e.g. `carla`) instead of the customer ID, and `roles`/`name`/`preferred_username` are all missing**

The `instanceof BankUser` check in the token customizer is returning false, so the customizer's body is being skipped entirely. The most common cause is using `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` to hold the users: it silently wraps each `UserDetails` and returns a plain `User` from `loadUserByUsername`, stripping the `BankUser` subtype. Confirm the `userDetailsService` bean uses the lambda form shown in Task 1.3, not `new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(...)`. If you have already switched to the lambda form and still see this symptom, also check that the import in `AuthorizationServerConfig` resolves to *your* `BankUser` (`com.example.authserver.users.BankUser`), not a Spring class with the same simple name.

**Token contains scopes the user shouldn't have**

The token customizer's intersection step is not running. If the `scope` claim in the decoded token is a JSON *array* rather than a space-separated *string*, the customizer didn't write it at all — see the troubleshooting entry above (the `instanceof BankUser` check is failing). If `scope` is a string but contains the wrong scopes, the user's `allowedScopes` constant is wrong; verify the `ACCOUNT_HOLDER_SCOPES`, `TELLER_SCOPES`, and `AUDITOR_SCOPES` constants at the top of `AuthorizationServerConfig` match the lab spec.

**The flow asks me to log in twice — once before consent, once after**

This is a session cookie issue, not a security misconfiguration. The browser treats `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as different origins, so a session cookie set during login on `localhost:9000` is not sent on the redirect to `127.0.0.1:9000`. Use the same host throughout: the authorize URL in `auth-requests.http` uses `http://127.0.0.1:9000` to match the registered redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:9000/authorized`. If you copy-pasted the URL but changed the host to `localhost`, change it back to `127.0.0.1`.

**Tokens become invalid after restarting the server**

This is expected. A new RSA key pair is generated on each startup. Re-execute the Client Credentials request in `auth-requests.http` or repeat the Authorization Code flow to get a fresh token.

**Authorization code exchange fails with `invalid_grant`**

Authorization codes expire in approximately 5 minutes and are single-use. Open the browser URL again to get a fresh code and exchange it immediately.

**The `mvn dependency:tree` output shows `7.0.x` for the authorization server**

The `<parent>` block in `pom.xml` is still set to Spring Boot 3.5 or higher. Change it to `3.2.5` as shown in Step 2 and reload the Maven project.

---

*Once the JWKS endpoint responds correctly and you have decoded tokens for at least one account holder, the teller, and the auditor, proceed to Lab 2-2 where you will build the Resource Server that consumes these tokens.*
